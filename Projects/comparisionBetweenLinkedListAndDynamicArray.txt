Comparision of Linkedlist and Dynamic Arrays


Dynamic Arrays-(Time Complexity) | (Space Complexity):
    getSize -             O(1) | O(1)
    doubleSize -          O(n) | O(n)
    insertAtEnd -         O(1) | O(1)
    insertAt -            O(n) | O(1)
    insertAtBeginning -   O(n) | O(1)
    isEmpty -             O(1) | O(1)
    deleteAtIdx -         O(n) | O(1)
    deleteAtBeginning -   O(n) | O(1)
    deleteAtEnd -         O(1) | O(1)
    reverse -             O(n) | O(n)
    rotate -              O(n) | O(n)
    merge -               O(n) | O(n)
    interleave -          O(n) | O(n)
    middle -              O(1) | O(1)
    firstOccurrence -     O(n) | O(1)
    print -               O(n) | O(1)



Linkedlist-(Time Complexity) | (Space Complexity):
    getSize -             O(1) | O(1)
    insertAtEnd -         O(1) | O(1) {with tail}
    insertAt -            O(n) | O(1)
    insertAtBeginning -   O(1) | O(1)
    isEmpty -             O(1) | O(1)
    deleteAtIdx -         O(1) | O(1)
    deleteAtBeginning -   O(1) | O(1)
    deleteAtEnd -         O(1) | O(1)
    reverse -             O(n) | O(n)
    rotate -              O(n) | O(1)
    merge -               O(n) | O(1)
    interleave -          O(n) | O(1)
    middle -              O(n) | O(1)
    firstOccurrence -     O(n) | O(1)
    print -               O(n) | O(1)



Advantages and Diadvantages-
-In operations like inserting at a given index or appending an element dynamic arrays are slow, while in linked lists we can just add a node in between to insert an element which reduces the time complexity.
-Extra memory is consumed to do some operations in linked lists.
-dynamic array is contigous while linked list is not contigous.
-dynamic arrays need to resized when their capacity is full while this is not the case in linked list.
-accessing the element is quick in Darrays while it is slow in linked list.
-both have different and important applications in programming
